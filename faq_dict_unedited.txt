        "question": "How will All of Us analyze my DNA?",
        "answer": "We plan to use different methods to analyze your DNA. This includes genotyping and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Genotyping looks at a small amount of DNA that gives us information about many of the common DNA differences among us. WGS looks at almost all of your DNA. The procedures we use to analyze your DNA are the same ones used by CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited sequencing labs. These are labs that specialize in DNA sequencing. We use these procedures to ensure that your results are of the highest quality we can provide. CLIA stands for the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988. These are federal laws and regulations that labs in the United States must follow if they want to analyze human samples for clinical care. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issues this certification. Being CLIA-certified means that the lab meets quality standards for both quality and safety when testing is meant for clinical care. CAP-accredited means a lab is accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP). To get this label, a lab must meet even stricter requirements than just getting CLIA certification. For example, the lab gets inspected on-site every two years under CAP's accreditation. Go to the CAP's Laboratory Accreditation Program website for more information. After we analyze your DNA, we add your DNA information to our scientific database. Your DNA information does not contain your name or other information that could directly identify you. We control who can access this database and require special training to use it. Researchers with access can study your DNA information."

        "answer": "The genes we analyze are based on a list maintained by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). The genes on the ACMG list have been well studied. This means we are confident that a genetic variant in these genes leads to an increased risk of a certain health condition. ACMG updates this list as researchers learn more about the links between genes and certain health conditions. Also, the genetic variants on this list are what we call 'medically actionable.' That means that there are certain steps you and your doctor can take when you learn your result. Together, you may help prevent a condition or detect it early if you know you have a higher risk. But remember, the results you receive from All of Us are research results and should be confirmed with a clinical test."

        "question": "Could my DNA information affect my health insurance?",
        "answer": "All of Us will not share your results with your health insurance company. Regardless, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) is a federal law that says health insurers cannot use your DNA information against you. All states and territories must follow federal laws. Health insurers cannot use your DNA information to change your coverage, drop you, or charge you more. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is another federal law that says health insurers cannot use your health information to decide whether to cover you. They also can't use it to decide how much to charge. Two exceptions are your age and whether you smoke. Another exception is if you are in a 'grandfathered' health insurance plan. Go to healthcare.gov for more information. The National Human Genome Research Institute has more information about these and other laws. The site includes information about exceptions to the laws."

        "question": "Could I have trouble getting or could I lose my disability, life, or long-term care insurance if I get my DNA results?",
        "answer": "The answer to this question will vary depending on where you live and the type of insurance you are asking about. Right now, there is no federal law preventing disability, life, and long-term care insurance companies from using your DNA information. Even though there is no federal law, some states or locations do have laws that say disability, life, and/or long-term care insurers cannot use DNA information to decide about your coverage. Still, in most places, these insurance companies can ask you if you have information about your DNA. You may have to tell them about your All of Us DNA results. They could use that information to decide if they will cover you and how much they charge. It could make it difficult to get these types of insurance. These types of insurance could be more expensive. It is your choice whether you want to get your DNA results. Some people don't think it is worth the potential risks on disability, life, or long-term care insurance. Others feel it is worth it because DNA results may have important health information that could help them and their doctors improve their health and wellness. Here are some steps you can take to learn how your All of Us DNA results may impact your disability, life, and/or long-term care insurance: Contact the insurance company and ask if they can use DNA information to decide whether to cover you and how much to charge you. Also ask if you are required to share DNA information with them. If you already have disability, life and/or long-term care insurance, read your policy carefully. Your policy will say what your insurance company can and cannot ask you for. It will also say if they can change the terms of your coverage or the amount they charge you based on the information you give them. Call the insurance company if you need help understanding your policy. Check to see if there are any laws where you live that say disability, life, and/or long-term care insurance companies cannot use DNA information to decide about your coverage. The National Human Genome Research Institute has more information about these and other laws."

        "question": "What is the difference between how All of Us studies my DNA and clinical DNA testing by a doctor?",
        "answer": "All of Us is a research program. We analyze DNA for research purposes. As we analyze your DNA, we can check it for information about your genetic ancestry and traits and for information that may affect your health. The purpose of clinical DNA testing is to help your doctor or health care provider diagnose or treat you. All of Us is not a health care provider and does not provide clinical DNA testing. If you receive health-related DNA results from All of Us, those results are not a diagnosis. Only a doctor or health care provider can diagnose you with a health condition and determine how to treat you. If you are concerned about your DNA results, it's always good to discuss them with your doctor or health care provider. Using their professional training, they may want to take additional steps. This may include ordering a clinical DNA test or sending you to a specialist who can order a clinical DNA test to confirm the results. If you do not have a doctor or health care provider, you may ask an All of Us genetic counselor to help you find one. Start by contacting our Support Center at (844) 842-2855 or help@joinallofus.org."

They also must agree to follow the rules and values of All of Us by signing our Data User Code of Conduct. Researchers who can see individual participant data will not be able to see names or other information that could identify someone directly.

GINA also says health insurers can't use DNA information to change your coverage, drop you, or charge you more. • The Americans with Disabilities Act says employers can't discriminate based on disability status. • The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act says health insurers can't use your health information to decide whether to cover you. Go to healthcare.gov for more information. Right now, there is no federal law that prevents disability, life, and long-term care insurers from using your DNA information to decide if they will insure you and how much they will charge you. Even though there is no federal law, some states do have laws that say these insurers cannot use DNA information to decide about your coverage. Please read your insurance policies carefully. They will say whether you have to share anything you learn about your DNA information. The National Human Genome Research Institute has information about these and other laws.

        "question": "What does 'disease risk' mean?",
        "answer": " 'Disease risk' is how we describe a person's chances of getting a specific disease or health condition. A lot of different factors affect a person's disease risk. Some of these factors we can control, like how often we exercise, what we eat, and whether we use tobacco. Other factors we can't control, like our genes, our ethnicity, and our age. The environment we live in also can affect our disease risk. If someone has a 'higher disease risk,' that means their chances of getting that health condition are higher than most other people's. It does not mean they have that health condition right now. It also does not mean that they will definitely get that health condition. If you are concerned about specific health conditions, or if you believe you are at risk for certain health conditions, All of Us recommends that you talk to your doctor or health care provider. If you do not have a doctor, you may ask an All of Us genetic counselor to help you find one. Start by contacting our Support Center at (844) 842-2855 or help@joinallofus.org."

If you choose the first option, researchers can still use the information you have already contributed. If you choose the second option, your information will not be used for new studies. We will destroy your samples. We will remove your information the next time we update the database. Once that happens, researchers who get All of Us data cannot get your data. If researchers already have your information, we at All of Us cannot get it back. Also, we will let researchers check the results of past studies. If they need your old data to do this work, we will give it to them. In both cases, we will keep your name and contact information. We keep this information so we can follow U.S. research laws and regulations. After you submit your change, you will receive a message that confirms your decision."

        "answer": "All of Us is asking lots of people to join. Participants are from different races and ethnicities, age groups, and regions of the country. They are also diverse in gender identity, sexual orientation, and health status. Diversity in a research program is important for several reasons. First, where we live, how we live, and our background can all affect our health. Second, many groups of people have been left out of research in the past. This means we know less about their health. By studying data from a diverse group of people, researchers can learn more about what makes people sick or keeps them healthy."

There is a difference between a medical genetic test and recreational genetic testing, like getting your genetic ancestry results. People sometimes use the phrase 'DNA testing' to talk about genetic testing. DNA kits that you can buy yourself are called direct-to-consumer genetic tests. These generally are not the same as the genetic tests that your doctor or health care provider use. *All of Us is a research program and does not provide medical tests for medical treatment or diagnosis."

If you are concerned about any results you get from All of Us, it is always a good idea to talk with your health care provider. Your health care provider will likely need to do additional tests to make a diagnosis. You or your insurance may be billed for tests your health care provider orders. Your health care provider may recommend new or different care based on these medical tests. You may want to make some of these changes to your care and not others. The changes in your care may cost more than your current care. Some of the changes in your care may not be covered by your insurance plan. It is your choice whether you want to get your DNA results. Some people don't think it is worth the potential costs. Others feel it is worth it because DNA results may have important health information that could help them work with their doctor or health care provider to improve their health and wellness."

They can change the way that we look (like whether we have dimples or not), impact other traits (like how we taste cilantro), or have no effect at all. Some helpful genetic variants can lower your risk of getting certain diseases. Sometimes, though, genetic variants can cause health problems or increase your chances of having health problems in the future. These kinds of genetic variants are called pathogenic variants or likely pathogenic variants. 'Pathogenic' means capable of causing disease. This means it could increase your chances of getting a disease but not that you definitely have a disease."

Half of your DNA came from your biological mom and half came from your biological dad. Your DNA is more than 99% the same as everyone else's DNA. The tiny amount that is different is what makes each of us unique."

Also ask if you are required to share DNA information with them. If you already have disability, life, and/or long-term care insurance, read through your policies carefully. Your policies will say what your insurance company can and cannot ask you for. They also will say if the insurer can change the terms of your coverage or the amount they charge you based on the information you give them. Call the insurance company if you need help understanding your policy. Check to see if there are any genetic privacy or genetic nondiscrimination laws where you live. Some states have laws that say disability, life, and/or longterm care insurance companies cannot use DNA information to make decisions about your coverage.

With more information, researchers can also be more sure that a difference they find is not caused by chance. That's part of the power of All of Us. There's also power in diversity. If a particular community of people has not been included in research before, they may possess unique information hiding in plain sight. That information could help researchers make discoveries. Those discoveries could improve the health of those communities."

If you print sensitive information, pick it up from the printer immediately. Shred your sensitive documents when you no longer need them. If you send sensitive information by email, protect it with a password or encrypt it. You can learn how to do that online. Don't download files onto public computers. If you have to download something, delete it before you log off. Don't post sensitive information on social media or apps. If you view your All of Us account on a public computer, log out when you are done. You can also clear your browsing history for extra protection."

        "answer": "Most likely, yes. The science of studying DNA is always evolving as scientists learn more. This means that over time, we may learn new information about how DNA can affect our health. For example, we might learn more about what diseases are connected with different genes. We might learn more about how your genes may affect the way you react to certain medicines we have already looked at. Or we may learn more about how you may react to other medicines we didn't look at before. We could also learn better ways to provide genetic ancestry and trait results as we learn more about diverse groups of people. If we do learn more, we would want to look at your DNA again. If we look at your DNA more than once, we will use the samples that are stored in our biobank. If we look at your DNA again, we will notify you only if we find something new that is important to your health. We will not send updated DNA results to you on a regular basis (such as each year).

We only share your personal report with you (and your doctor or health care provider if you ask us to). We do not share it with researchers. However, All of Us is a research program, not a doctor's office or hospital. We can generate DNA results for our participants as we do research. That is why our results are considered research results. These results need to be confirmed with a clinical DNA test.

Most people do not have something in their DNA that shows they are at risk of a serious health condition. Even if we do not find a risk in your DNA, this does not mean you will not get a health problem in the future. You could have a risk in a part of your DNA that we did not check. Scientists may learn about new risks in the future. Also, your chance of getting a health problem depends on many factors. Most health problems are not caused by changes in your DNA. Your lifestyle and environment also can affect your disease risk. It is always good to talk with your doctor or health care provider about what your DNA results may mean for your health and medical care. You will be able to talk to an All of Us genetic counselor about your health-related results. They can help answer any questions you may have.

        "answer": "What about medicines used on your skin or in your eyes or ears? How your body uses a medicine can depend on how it goes into your body. You can put a medicine in your body by eating, drinking, or injecting it. When you do that, your body takes steps to break the medicine down and use it. These steps are different from how your body uses medicine that you put on the outside of your body. This includes putting it on your skin or in your eyes or ears. We look at genes that are known to affect how a person's body uses medicine inside the body to create your Medicine and Your DNA report."

        "answer": "You have probably read that All of Us results are research results. That means that you should confirm our results with a clinical DNA test. A clinical DNA test is a test ordered by a health care provider. Clinical DNA tests look at which versions of genes you have. These tests can determine things like how someone might process certain medications or whether they have a greater chance of developing a serious health condition or passing on a genetic disorder. You can use clinical DNA test results in your medical care. Participants who have something important for their health in their Hereditary Disease Risk report will be eligible for this test. We estimate that about 2 of every 100 participants will be eligible for this test. Because these results are important for your health, we want to be sure that those participants can access a clinical DNA test at no cost. Remember, All of Us is a research program and does not provide health care or medical advice."

Your All of Us Hereditary Disease Risk report may show something important for your health in your DNA results. If it does, All of Us will connect you with a clinical DNA test to confirm that result. Clinical DNA testing is separate from the All of Us Research Program. All of Us will not know the results of your clinical test without your permission. If you are eligible for a clinical test and you agree to take that test, a licensed genetic counselor will work directly with you. They will help you to schedule that test and provide the results.

You can choose not to answer a question. Neighborhood Safety In this section, the survey asks if people in your neighborhood are willing to help each other and if you get along with people who live near you. This section also asks about graffiti, vandalism, noise, run-down buildings, and crime. Other questions ask if you think there is too much drug or alcohol use in your neighborhood. Built Environment and Walkability This section asks about the types of housing, recreation facilities, and stores or shops in the community where you live. Some examples of recreation facilities are parks, playgrounds, trails, and public swimming pools. It also asks if your neighborhood has sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and bus stops. Social Support This section asks about the support you receive from the people in your life. This includes help with everyday activities, like making food, doing chores, and running errands. It also includes feeling loved and appreciated by those around you. Loneliness This section is about your relationships with others. For example, are you an outgoing person? Do you ever feel left out or isolated from others? Everyday Life Discrimination This section asks how people treat you in your day-to-day life. Are you treated with respect? Are you insulted or harassed? Some people are treated badly or unfairly based on their personal qualities, like their race, ethnicity, physical appearance, or sexual orientation, to name a few. Health Care Discrimination This section asks how you are treated when you go to a doctor's office or another kind of health care provider. Are you treated with respect? Do you think the doctor or nurse is listening to you? Food Security Having enough healthy food to eat is important for health and well-being. This section asks how often you worry that your food will run out before you can buy more. Housing Security Having a safe and affordable place to call home is important for health and well-being. This section asks how many times you have moved from one home to another. It also asks if there are any problems in the place where you live, like mold, lead paint, or lead pipes. Stress Stress is the difference between someone feeling calm and in control or feeling overwhelmed. This section asks how often you feel nervous, stressed, or in control. Daily Spiritual Experiences To help researchers better understand if spirituality affects health, this section asks about your spiritual experiences. Some questions use the word 'God.' If you do not believe in God or a higher power, you can replace the word 'God' with your word or idea of what is spiritual, holy, or divine. If the question and/or answer options do not align with your beliefs, you can choose not to answer the question. Religious Service Attendance This section asks only one question. It asks how often you go to religious meetings or services. This information may help researchers understand if attending religious services affects health. English Proficiency This section asks if you usually speak a language other than English at home. If you answer, 'Yes,' then we ask you how well you speak English, in your own opinion. Language can be a barrier to health care if you prefer to speak one language and your provider prefers to speak a different one. When you share your English-speaking abilities with us, it can help researchers understand the relationship between speaking English and health outcomes."

If you say you want your DNA results, we will tell you what we find either way. Even if we don't find any risks in your DNA, this doesn't mean that you won't develop future health problems. You could have a risk in a part of your DNA that we did not check, or scientists may learn about new risks in the future. Your health also depends on many factors, including your environment and lifestyle. It's always good to talk with a health care provider about what your DNA results may mean for your care."

If we find this type of result in your DNA, it does not mean that you definitely have or will get a disease. Our genetic counselors can help you understand your results and what they mean for you. The results you receive from All of Us are research results, not a medical diagnosis. These results should be confirmed with a clinical DNA test. Because these results are important for your health, we will connect you with a clinical DNA test at no cost. If you choose to take this test, a genetic counselor will work directly with you to help you schedule the test and receive your results. You can also share your All of Us results with your health care provider. If you do not have a doctor or health care provider, we can help you find one."

        "answer": "Our DNA can affect how we respond to medicines. For example, some people may benefit from a medicine, others may not respond at all, and some may have side effects. This is called 'pharmacogenetics.' This type of DNA result can tell you how your body may process certain medicines. In some cases, pharmacogenetics results can help doctors and other health care providers choose what medicines to give you and how much to prescribe. DNA isn't the only thing that affects how you might respond to medicines. Other factors, like age, weight, health, diet, and other medicines you take, also affect how you process medicines. Doctors look at all of these factors together to determine what medicine and how much of it to prescribe you. Do not make changes to your medicines without talking to your doctor first. Changing your medicines or how much you take on your own could be harmful to your health. Learn more about genes and medicine in our Learning Center."

        "answer": "Our bodies are very complex. They require teamwork from many kinds of cells. Cells are made up of molecules. Proteins are a kind of molecule that carry out nearly everything happening inside our bodies. Genes are the instructions that tell your cells how to make different proteins. Each protein has its own job to do to keep our bodies running. A small difference in a gene's DNA can affect how these proteins do their jobs. This can affect our health or potentially cause disease. You may have heard about a 'breast cancer gene' or a 'baldness gene.' These terms are not quite accurate. There are not genes 'for' specific diseases or traits. Rather, sometimes genes come in different versions, and each of those different versions may be linked to certain traits or diseases."

        "answer": "Genetic variants are small differences in your DNA that make you unique. Everyone has genetic variants. Some happen to us by chance. Others are passed down to us through our biological families. Most genetic variants are harmless. They can: Affect the way that we look (is your hair curly or straight?), Impact other traits (is your earwax more likely to be dry or sticky?), Have no effect at all. Some helpful genetic variants can even lower your risk of getting certain diseases. But sometimes, genetic variants can cause health problems or increase your chances of getting health problems in the future. These kinds of genetic variants are called pathogenic variants or likely pathogenic variants. At All of Us, we refer to genetic variants as 'DNA changes.' "

Having one of these variants does not mean that you already have or will get that disease. It means that your chances of getting a disease may be higher than most other people's chances. Many factors can contribute to whether you develop a disease. Your DNA is one factor. Lifestyle and environment also play a role."

        "question": "How does my DNA affect how I might respond to medicines?",
        "answer": "Certain genes in our DNA affect how we respond to some medicines. Some genes help move medicines to the right part of your body. Some genes help break down medicines and clear them from your body. Small differences in your DNA can change how these genes work. These differences can be one reason why some medicines work differently for different people. For example, one important gene is called CYP2C19. People with a different version of the CYP2C19 gene may break down some medicines more slowly than other people do. This includes medicines such as some antidepressants and a blood thinner. If you break down a medicine more slowly, it might take longer for your body to feel the effects of the medicine than it does for other people's bodies. Or, the effects of the medicine might last longer for you than they do for other people. Learn more about genes and medicine in our Learning Center."

        "answer": "I don't want to be asked about each DNA result. We ask you to decide about each DNA result for a few reasons: We want to make sure you see information about the specific risks and benefits of getting each type of DNA result. We want to protect your privacy. Your DNA results reports will include personal information, like your name. It also may include sensitive information, like whether you have a hereditary disease risk. So, we will only generate a report if you tell us you want it. We plan to offer more DNA results in the future, so we do not have a complete list of options available right now."

        "question": "What are the benefits of getting these DNA results from All of Us?",
        "answer": "There are several benefits to learning about your DNA. You could learn something important for your health in your DNA results. Knowing this could help you work with your doctor or health care provider to prevent, detect, or treat disease. You could discover something that could help explain the history of a health condition among your blood relatives. Having this information could help you talk with your family. Everyone's DNA is different. But sharing your DNA results with your blood relatives can help them think about their own health. They can consider if they want to get tested themselves. You could learn that you have a version of a gene that may affect how your body responds to some medicines. If you do, your results will also contain a list of specific medicines that may be affected. You will be able to talk to an All of Us genetic counselor about your health-related results. They can help answer any questions you may have. Talking to an All of Us genetic counselor is free."

        "question": "What are the risks of getting these DNA results from All of Us?",
        "answer": "There are different risks to learning about your DNA. You could learn something unexpected from your results. For example, your results could show that a medicine you are taking may be affected by your DNA. You also could learn that you may have an increased risk of developing a serious health condition that you did not know about. If your DNA results show that you have a hereditary disease risk, you may have to share that information with companies that provide disability, life, and long-term care insurance. In most places, these companies can ask you if you have information about your DNA. Depending on local laws, you may have to tell them what you know. These companies could use that information to decide if they will cover you and how much to charge you. It could make it difficult to get these types of insurance. These types of insurance could be more expensive. Learning about your DNA could affect you emotionally, too. For example, you might discover that you are at risk for a disease that has not been seen in other members of your family. Your results could make you worried or confused. For example, you may be confused about the medicines you are taking. You may be afraid of passing a hereditary disease risk on to your children. You may wonder if you are related to a family member in the way you thought. Keep in mind that DNA results are not always the same for all blood relatives. You will be able to talk to an All of Us genetic counselor about your health-related results. They can help answer any questions you may have. Genetic counseling appointments are over the phone, free and confidential."

        "question": "What are the limits of getting these DNA results from All of Us?",
        "answer": "All of Us DNA results are research results. This means that these results should be confirmed with a clinical DNA test before using them in your health care. These results do not tell you whether you already have or will get a disease. Many factors can contribute to whether you develop a disease. Your DNA may contribute, but it is not the only factor. Lifestyle and environment can also have an impact. A lot of genes can affect your disease risk and how your body responds to medicines. We won't look at all of them. There could even be something we couldn't see or can't understand in the genes that we did look at. Scientific understanding of DNA is always growing. As we learn more, we may go back and look at your DNA again. We could look at more genes or look at the same genes again. We will contact you if we find anything important for your health in your DNA results."

        "question": "How likely is it that my DNA results will show that I am at risk for a serious health condition?",
        "answer": "Current studies tell us that about 2 of every 100 participants will get a Hereditary Disease Risk report that says they are more likely to get a serious health condition than other people. If we find this type of result in your DNA, it does not mean you already have this health condition. It also does not mean that you will definitely get this health condition in your lifetime. It is important to remember that many diseases and health conditions are not caused by genetics. Your DNA may contribute, but lifestyle and environment can also have an impact. You will be able to talk to an All of Us genetic counselor about your health-related results. They can help answer any questions you may have. Genetic counseling appointments are over the phone, free and confidential."

        "question": "What is the difference between DNA results from All of Us and those from DNA test kits I can buy on my own?",
        "answer": "Many companies sell DNA test kits that you can buy on your own. These kits are also called 'direct-to-consumer' or 'commercial' DNA tests because you don't need a doctor or health care provider to order the test. Different companies use different tests to analyze your DNA. The kits cost between $60 and $350, depending on the product and the type of test. Some commercial DNA testing companies offer an option to connect you with a doctor to order a clinical DNA test. All of Us is a public research program run by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is a federal agency. All of Us is focused on research. When All of Us participants give us a sample, we will analyze the DNA in the sample and make the DNA information available to researchers. We use different methods to analyze DNA. These include genotyping and whole-genome sequencing. All of Us does not share our participants' samples or DNA information with other research programs, and we do not sell it to anyone. One of the benefits of participating in the All of Us Research Program is getting your DNA information for free, if you want it. We plan to check your DNA for information about: Your genetic ancestry (where your family might have lived hundreds of years ago), Your genetic traits (why you might love or hate cilantro), Whether you may have an increased risk of developing a serious health condition, such as certain cancers or heart disease, How your body might react to certain medicines. Over time, we may offer more types of DNA results. You can always choose which DNA results you want. We would then share the results--which are not a medical diagnosis--with you through your All of Us account. You will not be able to see your DNA results immediately after joining. You will get your DNA results over time on an individualized timeline. If we discover new ways to analyze DNA, we might look at your DNA again in the future and have updated results for you."

We may find something in your Hereditary Disease Risk report that might be important for your health. If we do, we can connect you with a clinical DNA test. If you choose to take that test, you do not have to pay for it. Your doctor or health care provider can use the results of that test in your medical care."

        "answer": "No. Keep taking all medicines as prescribed by your doctor or health care provider. It can be dangerous to stop taking medicine. It also can be dangerous to change how much or how often you take it. Always talk to your doctor before making any changes. If your DNA results from All of Us show that a medicine you are taking may be affected by your DNA, your doctor will need to confirm the results with a clinical test. You can download a copy of the Your Medicine and your DNA report to share with your doctor. Together, you can decide if you should do a clinical DNA test.

There is no way to give or deny permission to use data about your DNA for a specific test or research question. If you no longer want researchers to be able to study your DNA, you can withdraw from the program at any time. If you withdraw: You can ask us to destroy any blood, saliva, and/or urine samples you provided. We will do so within three months. You also can ask that we not make your data available for new studies. We will remove your data. However, if researchers already have your data, we cannot get it back from them. Also, we will let researchers check the results of past studies. If they need your data from before you withdrew to do this work, we will give it to them."
